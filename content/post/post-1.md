### Spontaneous and forced wetting of rivulets {#spontaneous-and-forced-wetting-of-rivulets}

In this work\cite{ThammannaGurumurthy2018,Gurumurthy2018}, we investigated the
dynamics of rivulets in square capillary and open rectangular channel
array. Both spontaneous and forced wetting conditions were studied. The
two-phase flow was modelled using volume of fluid (VOF) method, and the
governing equations were solved using a two-phase solver in the open source code
\textbf{OpenFOAM}.
